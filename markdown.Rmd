#1. Load the data (i.e. 𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚍.𝚌𝚜
```{r}
cpw1 <- read.csv("activity.csv")
#explore dataset
names(cpw1)
head(cpw1)
dim(cpw1)
summary(cpw1)
```
#2. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
cpds <- tapply(cpw1$steps, cpw1$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```
#3. Histogram of steps taken by day
```{r}
png(file="plot.png")
hist(cpds, col="red", main="Steps Taken Each Day", xlab="steps", ylab="day")
```
#4. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean(cpds)
#9354.23
median(cpds)
#10395
```
#5. Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
```{r}
df2 <- tapply(cpw1$steps, cpw1$interval, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(df2, col="blue", type="l", xlab="interval", ylab="steps", main="Steps done by interval")
```
#6. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r}
which.max(df2)
#835
#206.1698
```
#7. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
```{r}
sum(is.na(cpw1))
```
#8. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
#9. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
```{r}
cpw1_new <- cpw1  # creation of the dataset that will have no more NAs
for (i in 1:nrow(cpw1)){
  if(is.na(cpw1$steps[i])){
    cpw1_new$steps[i]<- df2[[as.character(cpw1[i, "interval"])]]
  }
}
```
#10. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
```{r}
cpds_new <- tapply(cpw1_new$steps, cpw1_new$date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
head(cpds_new)
head(cpds)
dim(cpds_new)
dim(cpds)
```
#11. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?
#12. What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
```{r}
equality <- (cpds == cpds_new)
equality_new <- replace(equality, isTRUE(equality), 1)
mean(equality_new)
#0.8688
1 - 0.8688
#0.1312; the missing values affect in 13.12% the previous dataset
```
#13. Histogram of steps taken by day
```{r}
png(file="plot2.png")
hist(cpds_new, col="red", main="Steps Taken Each Day", xlab="steps", ylab="day")
```
#14. Calculate mean and median
```{r}
mean(cpds_new)
#10766.19
median(cpds_new)
#10766.19
```
